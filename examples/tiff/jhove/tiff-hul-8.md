This file is written in ["literate binary"][lb] notation, integrating binary
(expressed as hex code) with documentation written in [Markdown][Markdown]. To
derive an actual, binary TIFF file from this the [`lb` tool][lb] can be used.

# TIFF File Example

This file violates the [TIFF 6.0 specification][TIFF] because one of its IFD
entries has an invalid data type. It raises a [TIFF-HUL-8 "Type mismatch for tag
x; expecting y1 or y2, saw z"][TIFF-HUL-8] error when validated with
[JHOVE][JHOVE].

## Image File Header

Byte order (big endian) + number 42 + offset of first IFD.

    "MM" 002a 00000008

## Image File Directory

Number of directory entries.

    000a

Sequence of 12-byte IFD entries. Structure of each entry: tag + type + count +
value/pointer.

    0100 0001 00000001 005a0000 # ImageWidth, 90 pixels
    0101 0003 00000001 005a0000 # ImageLength, 90 pixels
    0102 0003 00000003 00000086 # BitsPerSample, pointer
    0106 0003 00000001 00020000 # PhotometricInterpretation, RGB
    0111 0003 00000003 0000008c # StripOffsets, pointer
    0115 0003 00000001 00030000 # SamplesPerPixel, 3 components
    0116 0003 00000001 001e0000 # RowsPerStrip, 30
    0117 0003 00000003 00000092 # StripByteCounts, pointer
    011a 0005 00000001 00000098 # XResolution, pointer
    011b 0005 00000001 000000a0 # YResolution, pointer

**Note that the ImageWidth entry in this IFD has type 0x0001 (BYTE) instead of
0x0003 (SHORT) or 0x0004 (LONG) as required by the TIFF specification, making
the file invalid.** However, TIFF viewer software *might* still be able to
render the image if the respective entry's value is not critical for rendering,
or if the viewer software "knows" the correct data type and can thus silently
ignore the type given in the IFD entry. In the case of ImageWidth in particular
none of these two conditions applies though (the ImageWidth value *is* critical
for rendering and it does not have one, but two possible types).

Pointer to next IFD or NULL.
