This directory contains files in ["literate binary"][lb] notation, integrating
handcrafted binary (expressed as hex code) with documentation written in
[Markdown][Markdown]. Two different representations can be derived from these
documents:

 1. PDF/HTML/Latex ... files, using a Markdown converter like [Pandoc][Pandoc].
 2. Binary files, using the [`lb` tool][lb].
